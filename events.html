<p>
6pm for a 6.30pm departure. Meeting in The North Bar Pub, North Stree <span class="event_title">Beating the Bounds</span> - Circular walk around medieval boundary of Leeds. Bring treats to share, flowers to leave and drinks to keep you warm! Expect poetry, and special performances from local artists. More details coming soon.
</p>
<p>
We will be walking in an anti-clockwise (widdershins) direction around the city, visiting the ancient boundary markers that defined the medieval boundaries of the city. Traditionally, feasting and sacrifices were performed during Terminalia at boundary markers, and we will do the same with things like poetry, cake, flowers or a drink! The boundary markers around Leeds are called bars (gates, possibly that barred off an entrance) and mark the borders where the city ended and the countryside began. Most are recorded and some still exist.
</p>

<p>
Bring yourselves, sticks, warm clothes and to share: some cake, drinks and flowers!
